This repository stores my revision and implementations of data structures, including:

- Dynamic Array (Source files: [Java](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/DataStructure/src/com/derek/Vector.java))
- Linked List (Source files: [Java](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/DataStructure/src/com/derek/LinkedList.java), [Python](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/linked_list.py))
- Hash Table (Source files: [Java](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/DataStructure/src/com/derek/HashTable.java))
- Heap (Source files: [Java](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/DataStructure/src/com/derek/Heap.java))
- Priority Queue (as Heap) (Source files: [Java](https://github.com/derekl-beep/data-structures/blob/master/DataStructure/src/com/derek/PriorityQueue.java))
- and more!

## Targets

Inspired by the famous [jwasham](https://github.com/jwasham)/**[coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** GitHub repository, I maintain this repo to keep track of my knowledge on the computer science fundamentals in a systematic manner.

I have been coding ever since my UG studies. My major was engineering (yes, not computer related), but I wrote MATLAB programs extensively to perform engineering calculation, run models and simulations for my projects. That's how I started programming, and this also led to my research studies on computational engineering later on.

Like [jwasham](https://github.com/jwasham) has written in his repo, when I first started coding, I also used the built-in data structures and algorithms to build programs without much in-depth understanding. For example, the time and space complexity of different operations, how memory are allocated, and etc. Reviewing these topics has helped me to be more confident to build efficient programs, and hopefully makes me become a better programemer.
